There are certainly more elegant ways to do this but... these resources were
generated by hacking `picard.sam.testers.SamFileTester.runTest` to copy the
files it generates on the fly to a non-volatile location; that location is also
written to stdout which appears in the test log format prepended with the test
name and test class:

```
            Path destdir = Paths.get("path/to/picard_tests", outputDir.toPath().getFileName().toString());
            Files.createDirectories(destdir);
            Files.walk(outputDir.toPath()).forEach(source -> {
                Path destination = Paths.get(destdir.toString(), source.getFileName().toString());
                System.out.println("@@" + destination + "@@");
                try {
                    Files.copy(source, destination);
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            });
```
With suitable grep and sed-fu on the logs one can match the qualified test name
to its resource directory, and rename suitably.

Only the tests from `QuerySortedMarkDuplicatesTester` are included (streammd
requires QNAME grouped inputs) and the following were omitted as non-relevant
due to known differences between how MarkDuplicates and streammd operate, as
well as the more limited scope of streammd:

```
*Barcode*
*BySumOfBaseQ*
*Histogram*
*MateCigar*
*StackOverflow*
*RepresentativeRead*
*UMI*
*UmiAware*
- tests involving mixed fragments and pairs
```

Original contents of each test directory:

* input.sam
* metrics.txt
* output.sam

In some cases the SAM files require additional processing to be used as streammd
inputs and/or compared to streammd outputs. For example, streammd always
recognizes the first occurring unique template as the "original" and subsequent
ones as duplicates. A README explaining any additional processing is present in
each directory where this was done.
