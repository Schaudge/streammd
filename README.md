# streammd

## Description

Single-pass duplicate marking with a Bloom filter. This is a probabilistic
approach to duplicate detection with the following features:

 * very fast (typically four to five times faster than Picard MarkDuplicates)
 * low in resources (5GB for 1B input reads)
 * tunable target false positive rate
 * streaming input and output

Detected duplicates have the SAM FLAG 0x400 bit set in the outputs.

Summary metrics are output to STDERR at the end of processing.

## Implementation

Currently only paired reads in qname-grouped order are supported. Soft
clipping is correctly handled when determining fragment ends.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/delocalizer/mumbai
cd mumbai
pip install -r requirements.txt --user .
```

## Test
(optional, requires tox)
```bash
TODO
```

## Usage

0. get help

```bash
streammd --help
```

1. mark duplicates on an input SAM file record stream 
```
samtools view -h some.bam|streammd
```
## Notes

### Memory usage

Memory usage depends on the number of items to be stored `n` and target
maximum false positive rate `p`:

### Handling outputs

When using the default number of consumer processes `streammd` generates
outputs to STDOUT extremely rapidly. This can mean the bottleneck in a
workflow becomes anything downstream of it â€” for example, if you want
to write the outputs to bam format using `samtools view` you should use
8 or more compression threads for optimal speed:
```
samtools view -h some.bam|streammd|samtools view -h -@8 -o some.MD.bam
```
